## Pointwise predictions using 3P-MSPointNet

### summary

This is an pytorch implementation for out 3P-MSPointNet semantic segmentaion network. In addition, data preprocessing, prediciotn results post-processing, GPS trip visualization  and the corrected [GeoLife](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52367) dataset are also included here.

Our work haven't published, so more details will be dispalyed only afetr pulication. 

It's recomended to open an issue for further information about the methodology.
